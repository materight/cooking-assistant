    so they stand up straight.
  - With a potato peeler, peel the skin off the pears leaving the stem intact.
  - Add the pears to the liquid and simmer covered on medium-low heat for 45 minutes.
    Turn the pears every 10 or so minutes so have an even color on all sides.
  - Once the pears are done cooking, remove them from the heat and allow them to cool
    on the stove for about 15 minutes.
  - Transfer to the refrigerator and cool for an additional 2 hours.
  - Serve standing up drizzled with the sauce and a side of vanilla bean ice cream.
    Give people a fork and a knife because although they're tender you'll still need
    to cut through them.

  - name: cheddar cheese
    amount: 250ml
  - name: pepper
    amount: 2ml
  - name: crackers
    amount: 500ml
  steps:
  - Bring a large saucepot full of salted water to a boil.
  - Cook the pasta until completely following the directions on the back of the package.
  - Drain and set aside.
  - While the pasta is boiling, melt 1/4 cup (60ml) butter in a saucepot.
  - Once the butter has melted, add the flour, whisk together, and cook for about
    3-5 minutes until the flour begins to take on some color.
  - Add the cold milk and whisk together so there are no lumps remaining.
  - Slowly bring the milk up to temperature so that it begins to steam then add the
    velveeta and the extra sharp cheddar cheese.
  - Give the cheese 10 minutes or so to melt into the milk.
  - Add the paprika, garlic powder, and pepper. By this point the cheese sauce will
    be quite runny - this is normal and exactly what you want.
  - Turn the heat down to low to keep it melted and warm.
  - In a large plastic bag, smash the goldfish crackers using a rolling pin or whatever
    you have. Just get them small - almost like breadcrumbs.
  - Add 1/4 (60ml) melted butter to the goldfish crackers then mix until thoroughly
    combined.
  - In a 9x13 inch (23x33cm) baking dish add the pasta and all of the cheese sauce.
    (Ignore the photo above, we made a smaller side portion and gave away the rest.)
  - Pour the goldfish breadcrumbs over the top and make an even layer across the entire
    dish.
  - Bake at 400°F (205°C) for about 20-30 minutes. You're looking for the cheese sauce
    to start bubbling up around the sides and for the crust to take on color.
  - Allow to cool for a few minutes then serve and fall asleep.

    flat strip of meat.
  - 'Set up three large plates for your breading station. First plate: flour. Second
    plate: 5 eggs beaten until smooth. Third plate: breadcumbs, parmesan cheese, oregano,
    black pepper mixed together.'
  - Bread each chicken breast by coating it in flour, shaking off the excess, dunking
    it in the eggs, shaking off the egg, then coating it in breadcrumbs. Push the
    breadcrumbs into each piece so they stick.
  - Repeat the breading process until all the chicken is ready.
  - In your largest skillet get 1/4 inch (1/2cm) of vegetable oil warmed up over medium
    heat. On our stove this was heat setting 5/10.
  - Once the oil is up to temperature add two chicken thighs into the pan. The oil
    should be hot enough to sizzle but not so hot that it pops and starts burning
    breadcrumbs.
  - Cook each piece 5 minutes on each side then move to a wire rack.
  - Repeat the process until all the chicken is cooked.
  - Serve as is or add tomato sauce and mozzarella then broil to make chicken parmesan.

    amount: 50ml
  - name: beef broth
    amount: 200ml
  steps:
  - Dice the onion and carrot finely
  - In an oven-proof skillet (cast iron is good) sautee onions and carrot on medium
    heat with a splash of olive oil for about 20 minutes (take your time)
  - Cut up the potatoes and begin to boil in salted water
  - Once the onions have color add in the ground beef and cook completely. Add the
    garlic at the last minute.
  - Drain any residual oil from the beef.
  - Add can of tomato paste and beef broth. You're looking for the consistency kind
    of like a thick chili or taco meat. Slightly juicy and tomatoey but not a soup.
  - Continue to boil the potatoes until fork tender (you're basically making mashed
    potatoes here...)
  - Heat up the butter and milk slowly on the back burner
  - Preheat your oven to 400° F...
  - Remove potatoes from water and run through a ricer
  - Fold in the warm butter mixture, do not stir too long or else you'll end up making
    glue
  - Add salt and pepper to potatoes until they taste right. If you screwed up and
    they're too thick just add milk, its okay.
  - Add the potatoes on top of the beef and cook through in the oven until the potatoes
    have a nice golden top.
  - Wait 20 minutes or so to cool.
