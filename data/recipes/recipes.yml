- title: macaroni and cheese with goldfish crust
  prep_time: 0
  cook_time: 60
  servings: 10
  ingredients:
  - 1 pound (0.5kg) shell-shaped pasta
  - 1/2 cup (120ml) butter
  - 1/4 cup (60ml) flour
  - 4 cups (1L) cold whole milk
  - 1 tsp (5ml) paprika
  - 1 tsp (5ml) garlic powder
  - 8 oz (250ml) Velveeta cheese
  - 8 oz (250ml) extra sharp cheddar cheese
  - 1/2 tsp (2.5ml) gound black pepper
  - 2 cups (500ml) goldfish crackers
  steps:
  - Bring a large saucepot full of salted water to a boil.
  - Cook the pasta until completely following the directions on the back of the package.
  - Drain and set aside.
  - While the pasta is boiling, melt 1/4 cup (60ml) butter in a saucepot.
  - Once the butter has melted, add the flour, whisk together, and cook for about
    3-5 minutes until the flour begins to take on some color.
  - Add the cold milk and whisk together so there are no lumps remaining.
  - Slowly bring the milk up to temperature so that it begins to steam then add the
    velveeta and the extra sharp cheddar cheese.

    be quite runny - this is normal and exactly what you want.

  - In a large plastic bag, smash the goldfish crackers using a rolling pin or whatever
    you have. Just get them small - almost like breadcrumbs.

    combined.

    dish.
