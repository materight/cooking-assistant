  ingredients:
  - name: pasta
    amount: 500g
  - name: butter
    amount: 120ml

  - name: cheddar cheese
    amount: 250ml
  - name: pepper
    amount: 2ml
  - name: crackers
    amount: 500ml
  steps:
  - Bring a large saucepot full of salted water to a boil.
  - Cook the pasta until completely following the directions on the back of the package.
  - Drain and set aside.
  - While the pasta is boiling, melt 1/4 cup (60ml) butter in a saucepot.
  - Once the butter has melted, add the flour, whisk together, and cook for about
    3-5 minutes until the flour begins to take on some color.
  - Add the cold milk and whisk together so there are no lumps remaining.
  - Slowly bring the milk up to temperature so that it begins to steam then add the
    velveeta and the extra sharp cheddar cheese.
  - Give the cheese 10 minutes or so to melt into the milk.
  - Add the paprika, garlic powder, and pepper. By this point the cheese sauce will
    be quite runny - this is normal and exactly what you want.
  - Turn the heat down to low to keep it melted and warm.
  - In a large plastic bag, smash the goldfish crackers using a rolling pin or whatever
    you have. Just get them small - almost like breadcrumbs.

    dish.
